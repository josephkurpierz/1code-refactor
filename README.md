#Horiseon

A pre-existing website that was doomed to `div` soup and repetitive coding.

It provided a good oportunity to work on semantic tags to deliver a more straight forward logical HTML file.

With the semantic tags in place it allowed CSS code to deviate from being **WET**.  Adding `class`es and semantic tags such as:
```
header
footer
section
article
```

In addition to cleaning up some code, `alt`s were added to describe meaningful images in order to provide a better experience for users in need of a screen reader.
